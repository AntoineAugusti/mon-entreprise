			Register your company to the French administration is the first thing to
			do. It can be done online with the following data :
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>The corporate name</strong>, also called "raison sociale" in
				french, is the legal name of your company, written on all of your
				administrative papers. It can be different from the trade name (used for
				commercial purpose).
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>The corporate purpose of the company</strong>, also called
				"object social" is a short phrase describing the activity of your
				company. As it is legally binding it must be composed with care,
				possibly with the help of a lawyer.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>The social security number of the director</strong>. In case you
				don't have yet a french social security number...
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>The address</strong>, the physical space where your company will
				be incorporated. In certain areas, you can benefit from substantial
				government aid (exemption from charges, taxes, etc.).
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
