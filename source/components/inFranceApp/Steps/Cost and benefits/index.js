				<h1>Hiring and social security</h1>
				<p>
					France has chosen to provide its citizens with a high-level social
					safety net. This mandatory system is based on solidarity and designed
					to ensure the general welfare of its people. All the benefits are
					included in the Social Security charges as standard.
				</p>
				<p>
					This easy access to health care and other services ensures that
					companies can put healthy, highly skilled, and productive employees to
					work in an attractive market in the heart of Europe.
				</p>
				<p>
					By paying in to this system, all of Franceâ€™s 2.2 million companies,
					3.2 million self-employed workers, and 25 million employees help to
					finance an all-included social insurance package.
